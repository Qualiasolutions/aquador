# Project Context: Aquadour Full-Stack Audit & Production Readiness

## Executive Summary
**Objective**: Execute a comprehensive review and audit of the Aquadour luxury perfume ecommerce platform across all layers to ensure production readiness, data integrity, feature completeness, and operational excellence.

**Project Type**: Full-stack ecommerce audit and production preparation
**Timeline**: 7 phases with systematic verification at each stage
**Stakeholder**: Production deployment team

## Project Overview

### Current State
Aquadour is a sophisticated **Next.js 14 App Router** luxury perfume ecommerce site for Aquad'or Cyprus with advanced features including:

- **Product Catalog**: 100+ perfumes across women/men/niche categories
- **Custom Perfume Builder**: Interactive fragrance creation with Stripe integration
- **AI Fragrance Consultant**: OpenRouter/Gemini-powered recommendations
- **Blog CMS**: Supabase-backed content management
- **Admin Panel**: Product/category/blog management (auth disabled in dev)
- **Advanced Cart/Checkout**: Context-based state with Stripe payments

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Supabase, Next.js API routes, Stripe webhooks
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with multiple product type systems
- **Payments**: Stripe with EUR currency, rate-limited APIs
- **Monitoring**: Sentry error tracking, Vercel Analytics
- **Testing**: Jest unit tests, Playwright E2E across multiple browsers
- **Deployment**: Vercel with custom domain (aquadorcy.com)

### Critical Production Concerns
1. **Admin Authentication**: Currently disabled with mock data
2. **Dual Product Systems**: Legacy static + new variant-based coexistence
3. **Data Integrity**: Verification needed between static catalog and database
4. **Real-time Updates**: Admin panel may lack real-time order/product updates
5. **Production Readiness**: Full checkout flow and payment verification needed

## Success Criteria

### Technical Excellence
- [ ] Zero TypeScript/lint errors in production build
- [ ] All E2E tests pass across browsers and devices
- [ ] Complete checkout flow verified end-to-end
- [ ] Admin panel fully functional with real-time updates
- [ ] Database integrity validated (no orphaned records)

### Business Readiness
- [ ] All products display correctly across categories
- [ ] Payment processing works reliably
- [ ] Admin can manage orders, products, and categories
- [ ] SEO and performance optimized
- [ ] Production deployment checklist completed

### Operational Security
- [ ] Admin authentication re-enabled and tested
- [ ] Rate limiting and security headers verified
- [ ] Environment variables documented and configured
- [ ] Error monitoring and logging functional

## Phase Structure

1. **Discovery** - Map tech stack, database schema, and existing functionality
2. **Frontend Review** - Pages, routing, product display, and UI/UX quality
3. **Checkout Verification** - End-to-end cart and payment testing
4. **Admin Panel Audit** - Full feature verification with real-time updates
5. **Backend & API Audit** - Security, validation, and error handling
6. **Production Readiness** - Build, environment, performance, and SEO
7. **Deploy Checklist** - Final production deployment guide generation

## Key Constraints
- **Preserve all existing data** - no deletion of products, orders, or records
- **Test mode payments** - keep Stripe in test mode during audit
- **Incremental commits** - atomic changes with conventional commit messages
- **Follow CLAUDE.md conventions** - respect existing code style and patterns
- **Real database operations** - test with actual Supabase data, not mocks

## Deliverables
1. **Fully audited application** - all issues identified and resolved
2. **DEPLOY-CHECKLIST.md** - comprehensive production deployment guide
3. **Summary report** - issues found/fixed with priority recommendations
4. **Phase verification** - confirmation all 6 phases passed successfully

## Context & Background
The Aquadour platform represents a high-end luxury ecommerce experience with sophisticated features like custom perfume creation and AI-powered consultations. The initial audit (7 phases) ensured enterprise-level reliability and user experience.

**Known Architecture Gaps** (Original Milestone - COMPLETED):
- Admin auth disabled (development mode) ✅
- Parallel product type systems need reconciliation ✅
- Real-time admin updates may be missing ✅
- Production environment configuration needs verification ✅

## NEW MILESTONE: Critical Security Vulnerabilities (2026-02-28)

**Milestone Trigger**: Comprehensive security audit revealed **NEW critical vulnerabilities** requiring immediate attention.

### Discovered Critical Issues
1. **🔴 CRITICAL**: Unprotected Admin API Route
   - `/api/admin/orders` bypasses middleware authentication
   - Can create manual orders without authorization
   - Immediate security risk

2. **🔴 CRITICAL**: Missing RLS Verification
   - Core tables (`products`, `orders`, `customers`, `admin_users`, `blog_posts`) have no confirmed Row Level Security policies
   - Potential data exposure vulnerability
   - Cannot verify protection in Supabase dashboard

3. **🟡 HIGH**: Bundle Performance Issues
   - 9,067-line `products.ts` static file adds ~200-400KB dead weight
   - Duplicates Supabase data unnecessarily
   - Significant performance impact

4. **🟡 MEDIUM**: Input Validation Gaps
   - Most API routes lack Zod schema validation
   - Manual validation is error-prone
   - Risk of malformed input crashes

5. **🟡 MEDIUM**: Production Logging Issues
   - 10 console.log statements in production code
   - Should use structured logging (Sentry)

### Milestone Objective
**Eliminate all CRITICAL and HIGH priority security vulnerabilities to achieve production-ready security posture.**

This security-focused milestone will systematically address each vulnerability with verification gates to ensure the platform meets enterprise security standards.
