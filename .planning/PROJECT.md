# Aquad'or E-Commerce Platform

## What This Is

A luxury perfume e-commerce site (Next.js 14, Stripe, Supabase, Resend) with a fully secured order-to-payment-to-confirmation pipeline, comprehensive security hardening, and optimized performance. Two checkout flows (cart and custom perfume) converge at a single Stripe webhook for order persistence and email delivery.

## Core Value

A customer completes a purchase and knows it worked — they see their order details on screen, receive a confirmation email, and the store is notified. No silent failures, no misleading messages, no security holes.

### Active

- [ ] Complete luxury design overhaul with new template and layout structure
- [ ] Perfect responsive design across all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Premium brand identity preserving gold accents with sophisticated color palette
- [ ] Smooth animations and micro-interactions throughout user journey
- [ ] High-end typography and spacing system for luxury feel
- [ ] Optimized perfume e-commerce UX (product discovery, customization, checkout)
- [ ] Homepage redesign with luxury brand storytelling
- [ ] Product catalog with enhanced visual hierarchy and filtering
- [ ] Custom perfume builder with premium interface design
- [ ] Cart and checkout flow with luxury shopping experience
- [ ] Customer account area with premium dashboard design
- [ ] Admin panel design consistency (maintain functionality, elevate aesthetics)

### Out of Scope

- Full order tracking page for customers — future enhancement
- Conditional shipping pricing — decided to keep all shipping free
- Checkout UX redesign — current flow works
- Mobile app checkout — web only
- CSRF token on checkout — low risk, rate limit sufficient
- Full CSP nonce-based approach — requires Next.js middleware changes
- Framer Motion replacement — 53 files, too broad for current scope
- Admin dashboard redesign — functional, not UX overhaul

## Current Milestone: v1.2 Design Overhaul & Premium UX

**Goal:** Transform Aquador into a luxury perfume e-commerce experience with Apple-level design quality, perfect responsiveness, and sophisticated brand presentation.

**Target features:**
- Complete visual overhaul with new luxury template preserving gold brand identity
- Perfect responsive design with precise spacing, alignment, and premium layout system
- Smooth animations and sophisticated micro-interactions
- High-end typography and visual hierarchy optimized for luxury perfume shopping
- Enhanced product discovery and customization experience with premium interface design

## Context

**Codebase:** Next.js 14 App Router, React 18, TypeScript, Supabase (ref: hznpuxplqgszbacxzbhv), Stripe, Resend, Sentry. Vercel deployment.

**Current state (post-v1.1):** 22,007 LOC TypeScript across 77 modified files in v1.1. All security vulnerabilities (RLS, GDPR, SQL injection, open redirect) addressed in code. Two Supabase migrations pending deployment due to migration history mismatch.

**Deployment blocker:** Supabase has 21 remote migrations not present in local history. Must repair migration history before pushing RLS policies and performance indexes.

**Two checkout flows:**
1. **Cart checkout** — `/api/checkout` → Stripe Checkout Session → `/checkout/success`
2. **Custom perfume checkout** — `/api/create-perfume/payment` → Stripe Checkout Session → `/create-perfume/success`

Both converge at `/api/webhooks/stripe` which persists orders and sends emails.

**Test coverage:** 74 API tests across 6/14 routes. Stripe webhook (21), checkout (9), blog (9), heartbeat (11), health (6), contact (10). AI assistant route untested (Jest fetch mocking limitation).

**Known tech debt:**
- Framer Motion in 53 files (~330KB) — needs tree-shaking or lazy loading
- Long files: reorder 610, ProductForm 568, categories 549, webhook 512
- LegacyProduct still used in FeaturedProducts, RelatedProducts, LattafaContent
- AI assistant route untested
- unsafe-inline in CSP (Next.js/Tailwind requirement)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Server-side price validation against product catalog | Client-sent prices cannot be trusted — core e-commerce security | ✓ Good |
| Standardize shipping as always free | Simplifies messaging, matches current behavior | ✓ Good |
| Enhance success pages with Stripe session data | Customers deserve to see what they ordered | ✓ Good |
| Use order record to gate email sending | Prevents duplicate emails on webhook retries | ✓ Good |
| Shortened metadata keys (pid/vid/qty) | Stay under Stripe 500-char limit on large carts | ✓ Good |
| Session-based order confirmation | Stripe session is single source of truth for success pages | ✓ Good |
| Order number = last 8 chars of session ID | Simple, unique, no extra DB column needed | ✓ Good |
| Database-based email idempotency | upsert ignoreDuplicates returns isNewOrder flag | ✓ Good |
| Centralize shared utilities | Eliminate code duplication across webhook and routes | ✓ Good |
| Webhook metadata reconstruction | Parse shortened format and rebuild from product catalog | ✓ Good |
| RLS with anon/admin/service_role layers | Defense-in-depth for database access control | ✓ Good |
| sendDefaultPii: false for GDPR | Prevent PII transmission to third-party (Sentry) | ✓ Good |
| PostgREST escaping for admin search | Prevent SQL injection via ilike special characters | ✓ Good |
| Permissions-Policy for browser API lockdown | Reduce attack surface for malicious scripts | ✓ Good |
| Build-time AI catalogue via prebuild | Fresh product data without cold start latency | ✓ Good |
| LegacyProduct deprecated, not removed | Gradual migration avoids breaking other components | ✓ Good |
| Zod cart validation on hydration | Prevents corrupt localStorage from crashing app | ✓ Good |
| useReducer initializer for cart state | Hydration-safe — reads localStorage once during init | ✓ Good |
| Public Supabase client for blog | Enables static/ISR rendering without cookie dependency | ✓ Good |
| Admin dashboard in-memory aggregation | 50% query reduction (10 → 5) with acceptable data size | ✓ Good |
| CSS-only backgrounds replacing Three.js | 600KB savings for minimal visual difference | ✓ Good |
| Explicit column selection constants | Reduces data transfer, documents expected schema | ✓ Good |
| getRelatedProducts with category param | Eliminates N+1 — caller already has category | ✓ Good |
| Consistent try/catch error handling | All 12 API routes return structured { error: string } | ✓ Good |

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Next.js 14, Stripe, Supabase, Resend — no new dependencies (tsx added for build scripts)
- **Backward compatible**: Existing Stripe webhook secret and checkout flow must keep working
- **No downtime**: Changes must be deployable without breaking live orders
- **Supabase schema**: Orders and customers tables already exist
- **CSP limitation**: unsafe-inline required by Next.js/Tailwind
