# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** A customer completes a purchase and knows it worked — they see their order details on screen, receive a confirmation email, and the store is notified. No silent failures, no misleading messages, no security holes.

**Current focus:** Planning next milestone

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 + v1.1 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (24 total).

**v1.2 Design Overhaul (Phase 10):**

| Decision | Rationale | Plan |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Use OKLCH color space instead of RGB/HSL | Perceptually uniform colors critical for luxury brand consistency, ensures predictable brightness across palette, WCAG contrast compliance easier | 10-01 |
| Fluid clamp() typography over breakpoint overrides | Eliminates maintenance burden, seamless scaling 375px-1440px+, professional responsive behavior | 10-01 |
| Expand Playfair to 5 weights (400-800) | Refined hierarchy for luxury headings, weight 500 as "luxury class" for featured content | 10-01 |
| Maintain backward compatibility for gold colors | Additive enhancement prevents breaking changes, all existing classes continue working | 10-01 |
| 44px minimum touch targets on all mobile interactive elements | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, accessibility standard for touch devices | 10-02 |
| Content-container 1400px max-width | Prevents content stretching on ultrawide, maintains readability | 10-02 |

**v1.2 Design Overhaul (Phase 12):**

| Decision | Rationale | Plan |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Use opacity-only transitions instead of y-axis movement | Prevents layout shift during navigation, maintains perceived performance | 12-02 |
| AnimatePresence mode="wait" instead of "sync" | Ensures exit animation completes before enter starts, cleaner visual flow | 12-02 |
| initial={false} on AnimatePresence | Prevents animation on first page load for faster perceived performance | 12-02 |
| Use layoutId for active nav indicator | Framer Motion shared layout animations provide smooth indicator movement between links | 12-02 |
