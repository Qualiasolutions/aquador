# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** A customer completes a purchase and knows it worked — they see their order details on screen, receive a confirmation email, and the store is notified. No silent failures, no misleading messages, no security holes.

**Current focus:** v2.0 Immersive Luxury Experience - Phase 13 (Parallax & Visual Foundation)

## Current Position

Phase: 13 of 17 (Parallax & Visual Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 3 (Plan 01 complete)
Status: In progress - Wave 1 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — Completed 13-01-PLAN.md (Parallax Visual Foundation)

Progress: [████████████░░░░░░░░] 66% (31/47 total plans complete)

## Milestones

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 + v1.1 + v1.2 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Recent decisions affecting v2.0:**
- v1.2: CSS-only backgrounds replaced Three.js (600KB savings) — informs 3D approach
- v1.2: Framer Motion in 53 files — needs optimization for parallax/3D features
- v1.2: Disable parallax on mobile Safari — pattern for v2.0 performance
- **Phase 13-01:** Framer Motion useScroll/useTransform for parallax (zero bundle increase)
- **Phase 13-01:** Speed-based parallax API (0.3=slow, 0.5=medium, 0.8=fast) over distance-based
- **Phase 13-01:** Parallax disabled by default on mobile (<768px) for Safari performance

### Pending Checkpoints

- ✅ ~~Supabase migrations~~ — DEPLOYED
- ✅ ~~AI catalogue generation~~ — Working on Vercel

### Open Blockers

**v2.0 Technical Considerations:**
- Need lightweight 3D library decision (Three.js removed, need alternative)
- Framer Motion bundle optimization required for heavy animation workload
- Mobile performance critical for parallax/3D features
