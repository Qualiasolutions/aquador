# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** A customer completes a purchase and knows it worked — they see their order details on screen, receive a confirmation email, and the store is notified. No silent failures, no misleading messages, no security holes.

**Current focus:** Planning next milestone

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 + v1.1 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (24 total).

**v1.2 Design Overhaul (Phase 10):**

| Decision | Rationale | Plan |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Use OKLCH color space instead of RGB/HSL | Perceptually uniform colors critical for luxury brand consistency, ensures predictable brightness across palette, WCAG contrast compliance easier | 10-01 |
| Fluid clamp() typography over breakpoint overrides | Eliminates maintenance burden, seamless scaling 375px-1440px+, professional responsive behavior | 10-01 |
| Expand Playfair to 5 weights (400-800) | Refined hierarchy for luxury headings, weight 500 as "luxury class" for featured content | 10-01 |
| Maintain backward compatibility for gold colors | Additive enhancement prevents breaking changes, all existing classes continue working | 10-01 |
| 44px minimum touch targets on all mobile interactive elements | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, accessibility standard for touch devices | 10-02 |
| Content-container 1400px max-width | Prevents content stretching on ultrawide, maintains readability | 10-02 |

**v1.2 Product Experience Enhancement (Phase 11):**

| Decision | Rationale | Plan |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Use OptimizedImage with fill mode and sizeType='full' for main images (quality 95) | Leverages Phase 10 image optimization with blur placeholders, ensures consistent luxury quality | 11-01 |
| Default zoom level 2x on click with transform-origin based on click position | Balances detail inspection with performance, natural zoom center based on user intent | 11-01 |
| Pinch-to-zoom threshold 20px to avoid false positives on swipe gestures | Prevents accidental zoom during navigation swipes, better mobile UX | 11-01 |
| Disable navigation (arrows, swipe, dots) when zoomed | Prevents confusion, clear single-purpose state (zoom mode vs navigation mode) | 11-01 |
| Increase transition duration to 0.4s with custom luxury bezier [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1] | Premium feel, slower timing feels more intentional and luxurious | 11-01 |
| 44px touch targets on mobile dot indicators | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, maintains accessibility standard from Phase 10 | 11-01 |

**v1.2 Interactive Design Polish (Phase 12):**

| Decision | Rationale | Plan |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Use OKLCH easing constants from globals.css for all animations | Maintains consistency with existing design system, perceptually uniform timing | 12-01 |
| Disable parallax scrolling on mobile viewports | Prevents jank and GPU layer issues on mobile Safari, improves performance | 12-01 |
| Reduce animation distance by 50% on mobile | Smaller screens need subtler movement, prevents excessive visual disruption | 12-01 |
| Default intersection threshold 0.2 with -50px margin | Triggers animations before element fully enters viewport, feels more responsive | 12-01 |
| Wrap product grids with AnimatedSection instead of animating individual cards | Prevents double-animation, cleaner code with internal stagger handling | 12-03 |
| Use key prop on AnimatedSection in ShopContent to prevent re-animation on filter changes | Animations only trigger on initial scroll, not when filtering changes product list | 12-03 |
| Enhanced button gold glow shadow on hover | More pronounced feedback aligns with luxury brand aesthetic | 12-03 |
| Add hover performance optimization with @media (hover: hover) | Prevents stuck hover states on touch devices, better mobile UX | 12-03 |

### Pending Checkpoints

- ✅ ~~AI catalogue generation~~ — Working on Vercel (323 products generated at build time)

### Open Blockers
