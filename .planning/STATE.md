# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

**Core value:** A customer completes a purchase and knows it worked — they see their order details on screen, receive a confirmation email, and the store is notified. No silent failures, no misleading messages, no security holes.

**Current focus:** Phase 8 complete — ready for Phase 9

## Current Position

Phase: 9 of 9 (Performance & Polish)
Plan: 5 of 6 complete
Status: In progress — executing Phase 9 wave 1
Last activity: 2026-03-03 — Completed 09-04-PLAN.md (query optimization & error handling)

Progress: [█████████░] 100% (21 of ~20 estimated plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 21
- Average duration: 2.81 min
- Total execution time: ~1.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 2 | 6 min | 3 min |
| 2. Payment Processing | 2 | 10 min | 5 min |
| 3. Order Confirmation | 2 | 3 min | 1.5 min |
| 4. Security Hardening | 1 | 1 min | 1 min |
| 8. Security & Data Integrity | 9 | ~30 min | ~3.3 min |
| 9. Performance & Polish | 5 | 16.7 min | 3.3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Phase 9 started: wave 1 in progress (6 parallel plans)
- 09-04: 5 min (query optimization & error handling)
- 09-06: 3 min (accessibility & clean code)
- 09-05: 5 min (bundle optimization & code cleanup)
- 09-03: 1.7 min (cart hydration & test fixes)
- 09-02: 2 min (blog & admin query optimization)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.0: Server-side price validation against product catalog
- v1.0: Database-based email idempotency
- v1.1: RLS enabled on all 9 tables with 24 policies (admin + anon + service_role)
- v1.1: Sentry GDPR compliance — sendDefaultPii: false, trace sampling 0.1 in prod
- v1.1: PostgREST injection protection pattern (escapePostgrestQuery)
- v1.1: Open redirect protection pattern (isValidRedirect)
- v1.1: Permissions-Policy disables camera/mic/geolocation/FLoC
- v1.1: Real React error boundary with Sentry integration
- v1.1: Zod cart validation on localStorage hydration
- v1.1: Build-time AI catalogue generation from Supabase (prebuild hook)
- v1.1: LegacyProduct type deprecated in favor of Supabase Product type
- v1.1: useReducer initializer pattern for hydration-safe cart state (09-03)
- v1.1: Semantic queries over data-testid in component tests (09-03)
- v1.1: Blog functions use public client instead of server client to enable static/ISR rendering (09-02)
- v1.1: Admin dashboard aggregates stats in-memory from batched queries instead of individual queries (09-02)
- v1.1: CSS animations preferred over heavy JS libraries for visual effects (09-05)
- v1.1: Category system uses three parts: static file (homepage), DB table (admin UI), enum (products) (09-05)
- v1.1: Preconnect to Supabase and Stripe for faster resource loading (09-06)
- v1.1: All form inputs must have htmlFor/id associations or aria-label (09-06)
- v1.1: Magic numbers in business logic extracted to named constants (09-06)
- v1.1: getRelatedProducts requires category parameter to eliminate N+1 query (09-04)
- v1.1: Explicit column selection via constants instead of select('*') for all queries (09-04)
- v1.1: Blog list queries omit content field to reduce payload size (09-04)
- v1.1: All API routes use consistent try/catch with structured error responses (09-04)

### Pending Checkpoints

- **08-01**: RLS migration file created but NOT pushed to Supabase (migration history mismatch)
- **08-08**: AI catalogue generation needs human verification (run `npm run generate:catalogue` locally)

### Deviations Noted

- **08-09**: AI assistant API tests skipped (Jest fetch mocking incompatible with native fetch). Coverage: 6/14 routes instead of target 8/14.
- **08-07**: 3 auto-fixed TypeScript deviations (Product type collision, Stripe mock, Zod error property)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Supabase migration push requires resolution of migration history mismatch (21 remote migrations not in local)
- unsafe-inline remains in CSP (Next.js/Tailwind requirement) — documented as known limitation
