# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

### Decisions

All v1.0 + v1.1 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (24 total).

**v1.2 Design Overhaul (Phase 10):**

| Decision | Rationale | Plan |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Use OKLCH color space instead of RGB/HSL | Perceptually uniform colors critical for luxury brand consistency, ensures predictable brightness across palette, WCAG contrast compliance easier | 10-01 |
| Fluid clamp() typography over breakpoint overrides | Eliminates maintenance burden, seamless scaling 375px-1440px+, professional responsive behavior | 10-01 |
| Expand Playfair to 5 weights (400-800) | Refined hierarchy for luxury headings, weight 500 as "luxury class" for featured content | 10-01 |
| Maintain backward compatibility for gold colors | Additive enhancement prevents breaking changes, all existing classes continue working | 10-01 |
| 44px minimum touch targets on all mobile interactive elements | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, accessibility standard for touch devices | 10-02 |
| Content-container 1400px max-width | Prevents content stretching on ultrawide, maintains readability | 10-02 |

### Pending Checkpoints
