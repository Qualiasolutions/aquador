/**
 * Discovery Animation Library
 *
 * Luxury animation variants for progressive disclosure and hover reveals.
 * Optimized for immersive product browsing with smooth, intentional timing.
 *
 * Design Philosophy:
 * - Hover reveals should feel like peeling back layers, not sudden jumps
 * - Progressive disclosure creates anticipation and guides attention
 * - Image zoom is subtle (1.06x) for luxury feel vs aggressive scaling
 *
 * Performance:
 * - All animations use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity, filter)
 * - Timing optimized for 60fps smooth scrolling
 * - Reduced motion support for accessibility
